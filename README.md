# Equalizer and Virtual Instruments

##  **Introduction**

In music world, each instrument have a certain range of frequencies, manipulating this range enables us to amplify, reduce or even delete the sound ofthis instrument in a signal.<br />
In the other way around, we can generate the instrument sound using mathematics, by functions that have a certain frequency and wave form.
<br />
<br />

##  **Describtion**
My UI enables you to manipulate your song, by controlling some basic instruments, delete them, amplify the or slightly decrease them.<br />
It shows you the signal's wave form and the spectrogram, so you can see the effect of the manipulation you applied.<br />
You can compose a note also by some virtuall instruments provided by the UI.

<br />

##  **How it works**
* First import your song.
* Then you can manipulate the instruments you want.
* In another tabs, you will find the virtual instruments where you can compose a little piece of music for you.<br />
