# Music-Equalizer-and-Virtual-Instruments
The application is divided into 2 sections.

The first section is a music equalizer where music can be uploaded and increase/decrease the volume and play with the sound of 3 instruments: Piano, Guitar, Flute along with the music's histogram
The signal processing on the music is done using fourier transform.

The second section is for the virtual instrumetns where the user can play 3 different instruments: Piano, Guitar, Drum
The sounds of the piano keys, guitar strings and the drum is synthesized from mathematical equations given many parameters as the frequency and the amplitude.

The application is written fully in python
